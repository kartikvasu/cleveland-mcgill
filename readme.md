# Cleveland_McGill
This basically replicates the classic data visualization performance experiment conducted by Cleveland and McGill in 1984 where the task was to compare two different data points in a data visualization (ratio comparison). They found that pie charts were pretty bad compared to bar charts. This laid the foundation for data visualization technique comparison (and also perpetuated the hate for pie charts within expert circles).

I will be posting screeshots of the experiment here soon. 

In the meantime, <a href = "https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/courses/cpsc533c-04-spr/readings/cleveland.pdf">here's</a> a link to the paper written about the experiment in '84.
